          <p>U.S. Navy Cmdr. Ernest Krause is assigned to lead an Allied convoy across the Atlantic during World War II.
            His convoy, however, is pursued by German U-boats. Although this is Krause's first wartime mission, he finds
            himself embroiled in what would come to be known as the longest, largest and most complex naval battle in
            history: The Battle of the Atlantic.</p>
